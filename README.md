**Disadvantages and Advantages**



**Recursive Approach:**

Advantage:


It directly reflects the mathematical definition of the recurrence relation, making the code concise and easy to understand.


Disadvantage:

It can be computationally expensive for large values of n due to repeated function calls, resulting in redundant calculations.


**Iterative Approach:**

Advantage:

It avoids the overhead of function calls, making it more efficient than the recursive approach for large values of n.

Disadvantage:

It requires maintaining additional variables and a loop, which can make the code slightly more complex.


**Memoization Approach:**

Advantage:

It combines the advantages of both the recursive and iterative approaches by avoiding redundant calculations through caching of previously computed values.

Disadvantage:

It requires additional memory to store the cache, which can be a concern for extremely large values of n.
The choice of which approach to use depends on the specific requirements of your problem. If efficiency is a concern, the iterative or memoization approach is generally preferred. However, if simplicity and readability are more important, the recursive approach may be sufficient.
